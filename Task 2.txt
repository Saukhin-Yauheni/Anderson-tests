[Task_2]
Answer the questions 
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]] 
Can this sequence be considered correct? 
If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct? 

Answer:
No, sequence not correct - because not all of brackets are closed, also we don't have full specifitaion for this task.
Possible solutions (with stec rule, one opens another - closing):
1: changing one of the last "]" to rounded ")" [((())()(()))] 
2: in case if sequence of some empty spec. was supposed to see solution just in rounded brackets deleting all "[","]" and adding one rounded bracket in the end ")" - ((())()(())) ;
3: adding one opening bracket "[" and closing ")" - [[((())()(()))]] ;

4: in case of deleting on of the last "]" then bracket would be incorrect - [((())()(())]
